# The Cutting-Plane Method for Solving Convex Programs

by J.E.Kelly(1960)

## Problem Definition


$$ min\  c^Tx $$
$$ s.t.\ G(x)\leq 0$$

$x \in R^n$ and $c \in R^n$, so the objective function is a linear form.\
$G(x)$ is continuous convex function defined on $S=\{x\in R^n|Ax\leq b\}$.\
We wants to find the optimal solution $x^*$ for this problem.
